# Secure-Passwords

# Overview
This Python program securely manages website passwords. It encrypts credentials, analyzes password strength, and lets you add, delete, update, and view them (decrypted for a short time). It can also open website login pages or copy passwords to your clipboard. Currently educational, it lays the foundation for a robust password management solution.
